0 - Introduction
==================

YafRay is a command line raytracer, so if you don't like command line 
programs maybe you're insterested in a GUI. Visit www.yafray.org for 
more info.

The syntax is:

yafray [options] file.xml

==================
1 - WARNING!!!
==================

If you're using YafRay since first versions, please be careful with a possible deprecated yafray.bat in your \windows folder. It could make YafRay fails. You have to delete it.


==================
2 -YafRay Options
==================

-c N 	-> Where 'N' is the number of CPU's to use 
	   (for multi-proccesor computers)
-z	-> Use net optimized (under mosix clusters)
-p PATH -> Where 'PATH' is the installing path of YafRay. By default YafRay
	   uses Windows registry to locate grammar file and plugins dir, so
	   this option is not needed (If all runs fine ;-) ).
-v  	-> Shows YafRay's version.	

NEW in 0.0.6: 

-r min_x:max_x:min_y:max_y 	-> Render region. Values between -1 and 1. 
				   Whole Image is -r -1:1-1:1

For show the options, just type yafray and press ENTER


==============================
HOW TO SET yafray.exe IN PATH
==============================

YafRay Installer doesn't add yafray executable to your PATH environment variable. So if you wish execute YafRay from any directory you need add YafRay's installation directory to the PATH variable yourself.


I will assume that YAFRAY_DIR contains the YafRay installation directory. 
If example, if you have installed YafRay in c:\Program Files\yafray you must
change YAFRAY_DIR with c:\Program Files\yafray in the lines below.
