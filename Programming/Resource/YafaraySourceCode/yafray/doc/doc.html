<h1> NONAME FAST AND BAD DOCUMENTATION </h1>

<p>

I think is better to explain it in a bottom-up order. So we'll start with
the basis of the program. The elemental data types that the raytracer uses
are:
</p>
<UL>
	<li> 3d points (vectors) - vector3d.h </li>
	<li> Colors (RGB) - color.h </li>
	<li> 4x4 matrix (transformations) - matrix4x4.h </li>
</UL>
<p>
Those types have some operators defined such as +,-,* in order to perform the
trivial operations. I think they are intuitive, if you don't know what an 
operator does, you'll have to read the code or wait for a better doc.
</p>
<p>
Over those objects, we define the virtual class "object3d_t". This class has
a redeuced set of basic metods for ray intersection and shader handling. So
you can define whatever type of object (nurbs, mesh, primitive, etc ...) only
by defining the constructor, and ray intersection (this is the hard work) 
methods.
</p>

<h2> RAY SHOOTING </h2>

<p>
A ray can be represented by a given point and a direction. So two 3d vectors.
But you will find that instead of getting the intersection with that ray, 
is easier
to find the intersection with the Z axis. So when we shoot a ray, we build a
transformation matrix wich transform the given ray into the Z axis.
</p>
<p>
So imagine you are an object (mesh, nrubs ...). If I want to know where a ray
intersects with you, I give you the ray-to-Z matrix and its inverse (to save 
time). You only have to apply yourself that matrix and find where the Z axis
intersects with you. Then, if it hits you, you apply the inverse 
matrix to that point and thats all, you'll get the original intersection.
</p>
<p>
This is the reason why in the raytracer, the rays are represented by two
matrix. The ray-to-Z-axis and its inverse. So the object_t type (an abstract
type) has this interface:

class object3d_t
{
	public:
		object3d_t() {radiosity=true;rad_pasive=true;shadow=true;};
		virtual int type() const =0;
		virtual void transform(matrix4x4_t &m) =0;
		virtual vector3d_t toObject(const vector3d_t &p)const=0;

		virtual bool shoot(const matrix4x4_t &rtoz,
		const matrix4x4_t &ztor,surfacePoint_t &where,bool shadow=false)const=0;
		
		virtual bound_t getBound() const =0;
		void setShader(shader_t *shad) {shader=shad;};
		shader_t *getShader() const {return shader;};
		bool useForRadiosity() const  {return radiosity;};
		void useForRadiosity(bool r) {radiosity=r;};
		bool reciveRadiosity() const  {return rad_pasive;};
		void reciveRadiosity(bool r) {rad_pasive=r;};
		bool castShadows() const  {return shadow;};
		void castShadows(bool r) {shadow=r;};
	protected:  
		shader_t *shader; 
		bool radiosity; 
		bool rad_pasive; 
		bool shadow; 
}; 
</pre>
</tt>
<p>
As you see, most methods are basic material properties. Look at the method 
called <tt> shoot </tt>. It takes the two discussed matrix , a reference to a
surface point and a bool called <tt> shadow </tt>.<br>
The surface point is an special type wich holds the <I> hit </I> information.
It contains data as normal,point, texture coords, and other ray intersection
variables. It's used to make the shading. So when this method returns <I>true
</I>, it will fill the surface point with the needed data. You can find the
<tt> surfacePoint_t </tt> definition in <tt> surface.h </tt>.
</p>
<p>
The shadow parameter is used for shadow detection. When you only want to know
if the object is intersected and how far of the ray origin, you set it to 
<I> true </I>. Then the method will skip the normal and other unnecesary data
calculation.
</p>

<p>
Now look at the <tt> getBound </tt> method. It returns a bount_t object, which 
is the implementation of the bounds containig that object. The bound 
definition can be found in <tt> bound.h </tt>. And are used for the ray shooting
acceleration. <br>
And finaly I gonna explain one more method, the transform method. It's a method
for setting the object transform from object coordinates to world coordinates.
When you call this method, you give it a matrix wich could be any composition of
linear transformations (rotating, moving ...). If an object has a 
transformation, and you call this method, it will clear the old transformation.
There is no composition, you have to do all the compositions before calling this
method.
