jandro:
	* Pathlight, and GI in general
		Code has been mostly rewritten to improve all the GI system 
		based on this light. Lot of bug fixes and speed ups.
		* Better handling of antialiasing.
		* Cache coords changed to screen coords, what makes it faster.
		* Improved refinement and interpolation.
		* Refinement stages can be now customized with max_refinement.
		* New per sample refinement scheme, using same params as cache
			refinement. Adaptively increases samples where needed.

jandro:
	* Fixed automake build system.

eeshlo:
	* Fixed arealight single sample red render bug.

eeshlo:
	* Fixed white render bug when gpm used with pointlight.

jandro:
	* Scene size causing artifacts is no longer a problem.

eeshlo:
	* Spotlight major fix.
		* Halo fixed.
		* Now using stratified sampling for faster converging 
			smoother shadows.

eeshlo:
	* Camera new ortho mode.

jandro:
	* Photons memory usage improved in globalphotonlight.
		* Direction compressed using Jensen scheme.
		* Color compressed using rgbe format.

jandro:
	* Build osx package with just scons osxpackage.

jandro:
	* Plugin working for at least linux, osx and win32, thanks to 
		pmartin, who gave me the starting point for the msvc build.
		* Memory coherence mostly fixed for msvc build, but some 
			bugs might remain still unsolved.

jandro:
	* Spacial hash table rewritten, better scheme (no longer a hash).

jandro:
	* Output class can now stop the render, what allows ESC key feature
		in blender.

jandro:
	* New accell tree implementation for meshes, now pure BSP. This
		gives an speed up in most scenes.

jandro:
	* New render strategy, rendering image blocks (buckets). Improves
		performance because of cache coherency. Also makes nicer output
		and we use less memory.

Steve Smith:
	* New fork/thread render scheme (temporary disabled).

guitargeek:
	* Added shaderback background type. Takes a shader block input
		as color for background.
		* Syntax:
			  <background type="shaderback" name="world" >	  <input
			  value="sky" /> </background>
		* Any block or combination can be used now as background.
